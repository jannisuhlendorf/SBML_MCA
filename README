SBML-MCA
--------
SBML-MCA is a set of tools written in python to perform 
metabolic control analyses on biochemical network models 
provided in the SBML format. Functionalities inlude the 
computation of first and second order response coefficients, 
elasticities, first order control coefficients and the first 
order spectral response coefficients.
Additionaly the tools allow to compute the propagation of 
perturbations in a biochemical network and the construction 
of kinetic SBML models from structural SBML models and data 
on the steady state.
SBML-MCA is provided under the MIT license. See the COPYING
